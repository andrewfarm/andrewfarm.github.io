                <p>Hello! Glad you made it. I actually just started this from scratch a little while ago, so there's not much here yet. Before you leave (and come back in the future), here's <a href="http://xkcd.com">today's xkcd comic!</a></p>

                        <h2>About</h2>
                        <p>My name is Andrew Farm. I grew up in Maine, where I discovered my love of computer scieblah blah blah, let's' get to the good stuff. Well, I'm currently in college majoring in CS and minoring in being an unmotivated blob (future employers please read: a hardworking and enthusiastic job candidate) and reveling in the joys of a roomate with no sleep schedule discernable by any branch of modern mathematics.</p>
                        <p>If you've made it this far, let me take a moment to congratulate you. Congratulations! You deserve a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/lsWPzG9.gif">treat</a>.</p>
                        <p>Let make take a moment to explain why I'm doing this. I have no idea. Having a personal website seems like, I dunno, a developer-y thing to do. Did you see the transition from the landing page to this one? Yeah, that's right. Niiiice and developer-y. There's also some pretty pictures from my photography hobby (or there will be) and some music I've written. So yeah, check those out too, I guess. Or don't. I haven't figured out how to force my website visitors to appreciate my work. (Maybe python?)</p>
                        <p>I figure that around now, people will start to get bored of my rambling (if they haven't already switched to a different tab) and will want to see some pictures. Well, they're in luck! I included a bunch of demos of project's I've done because I think that's what you're supposed to do? By the way, I wrote a lot of this in Java; Java applets are being discontinued, ipso facto I had to manually port thousands of lines of code. Ipso facto, you had darn well better appreciate it.</p>
